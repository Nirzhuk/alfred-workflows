# Alfred

**Alfred** is a local desktop app for building automations across your AI coding agents.

Compose workflows as visual graphs: write prompts, route them through agents you already use on your machine, optionally pin a **skill** and a **model**, then run the sequence and choose which outputs to keep.

> **Free and open source.** The complete source is available under
> [GPL-3.0-or-later](LICENSE). Official maintainer-built installers are
> published as public
> [GitHub Release assets](https://github.com/Nirzhuk/alfred-workflows/releases/latest)
> — free for everyone, no purchase, no account.

| Get Alfred | Cost | What you get |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Official builds** | **Free** | Maintainer-built, CI-tested installers from GitHub Releases. macOS builds are Developer ID signed, notarized, and stapled; the Windows installer is an unsigned beta |
| [Build from source](docs/building-from-source.md) | **Free** | A local build you compile yourself, with every feature |

Updates are **manual**. Alfred has no automatic updater: **Help → Download
Latest Version…** opens the GitHub releases page in your browser, where you
download the newer installer and install it over your existing copy. Your
workflows, runs, schedules, and memories are local and survive an upgrade.

Fees charged by Claude, Cursor, OpenAI, or other agent providers for their own
services are separate from Alfred in every case. See
[Open-source and distribution policy](docs/open-source.md) for details.

## Install

**User guide:** [docs/install.md](docs/install.md) — official installers,
source builds, OS requirements, and agent CLI setup.

Short version:

1. Download an official installer from
   [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Nirzhuk/alfred-workflows/releases/latest)
   or [compile from source](docs/building-from-source.md) — both free, both
   fully featured.
2. Install and sign in to at least one agent CLI you plan to use:
   - Claude Code → `claude`
   - Cursor Agent → `cursor-agent` (or `agent`)
   - Codex → `codex`
   - OpenCode → `opencode`
   - GitHub Copilot → `copilot`
   - Gemini CLI → `gemini`
   - Grok Build → `grok`
3. Confirm the CLI works in a normal terminal, then open Alfred and run a workflow.

Alfred does **not** replace those subscriptions or store their API keys. It shells out to CLIs that are already authenticated on your machine.

Schedules, file triggers, and webhooks only run while the app is open (including tray / menu bar).

## What it does

- **Workflows as automations** — sequences of inputs → agent steps → outputs. Every workflow can be run manually; scheduling is an optional later trigger for the same automation.
- **Multi-agent** — Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, OpenCode, GitHub Copilot, Gemini, and Grok via local CLIs.
- **Skills** — pin a `SKILL.md` skill on an agent step (invoked as `/skill-name …`).
- **Models** — pick the model/alias each agent should use (`sonnet`, `gpt-5`, `provider/model`, etc.).
- **Triggers** — optional cron schedules, file watchers, and loopback webhooks.
- **Local persistence** — workflows, runs, memories, and schedules in SQLite on disk.

## Core ideas

| Concept | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Prompt node | The instruction text fed into the next step |
| Agent node | Which CLI runs, with optional model + skill |
| Choose output | Pick which result continues downstream |
| Run | Manually enqueue/execute the automation |
| Schedule | Optional cron that fires the same runner while the app is open |

## Platforms

Desktop only: **macOS 11+**, **Windows 10/11**, and **Linux**. Android, iOS, and standalone website builds are not supported.

Official binaries are published on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Nirzhuk/alfred-workflows/releases/latest):
macOS `.dmg` (Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows `.exe`/`.msi`, and Linux
`.deb`/`.rpm`/`.AppImage`. The Windows installer is an **unsigned beta**:
Windows reports an unknown publisher and may show a SmartScreen warning. See
[installing](docs/install.md), [building from source](docs/building-from-source.md),
and the [maintainer release runbook](docs/releasing.md).

## Develop

```bash
bun install
bun run dev      # desktop app (Tauri)
bun run build    # desktop installers for the current OS
bun run check    # frontend tests/build + Rust tests
```

Frontend Vite is started automatically by Tauri (`dev:frontend` / `build:frontend`). Do not use Vite alone as a website.

The complete platform prerequisites and expected artifact paths are in
[docs/building-from-source.md](docs/building-from-source.md).

### Stack

- **UI** — React + React Flow (`@xyflow/react`)
- **Shell** — Tauri 2
- **Data** — SQLite (`rusqlite`) in the Rust backend
- **Execution** — Rust agent adapters that spawn local CLIs
